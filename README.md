# Salary Prediction Project

The objective of the project was to predict whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year based on their characteristics, using the adult dataset from the University of California Irvine. The project involved data preprocessing, handling missing and outlier values, differentiating supervised learning models, and analyzing variables through histograms and box plots. We implemented logistic regression, K nearest neighbors, and decision tree models and evaluated their performance.
